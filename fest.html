    <p class="mag">The Magdadaran Talip Festival is a cultural celebration from Carasi, Ilocos Norte, that depicts the Isnag tribe's rich culture and traditions <br>
        The name Magdadaran Talip is an Isnag phrase that means "gathering for a dance". <br>
        The festival features the Talip, Taddah, and Sarigsig dances, which are important to the Isnags. The dancers wear traditional clothing made from indigenous materials, and perform stylized dance steps to the beat of ganza and ludag. <br>
        The festival is a way for the Isnags to express their collective feelings about significant life events through dance.<br><br>
